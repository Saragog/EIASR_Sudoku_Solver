	This file is a part of a university project Sudoku Solver
	that was developed as a EIASR project.
	The aim is to create a software program, that is capable of recognizing sudoku problems
	read from photographs. The program is using OpenCV library.

	This file describes a class that is used as a simple aplication that can be run from our
	simple gui.
